# Problem Statement

Most students struggle to stay organized, prioritize tasks, and track progress throughout their academic and personal activities. Traditional to-do apps often lack personalization, motivation, and analytics, making it difficult for users to stay consistent. This project aims to build a Personal Task Manager with Motivational Insights, helping users manage tasks efficiently while staying motivated.

The project includes designing and developing a task management system that allows users to create, update, and track tasks with added motivational support and analytical insights. It covers task storage, visualization through charts, optional reminders, and user-friendly interaction via a command-line or GUI-based interface.
